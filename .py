Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
      How I wonder what you are!
          Up above the world so high,
             Like a diamond in the sky.

When the blazing sun is gone,
     When he nothing shines upon,
        Then you show your little light,
            Twinkle, twinkle, all the night)
